### Simulation/Analysis scripts for NEST integration into larnd-sim

- The detector simulation for the ND-LAr prototypes is done with `larnd-sim`: https://github.com/DUNE/larnd-sim 

- Reconstruction and processing of real data and simulation is done with `ndlar_flow`: https://github.com/DUNE/ndlar_flow

- Reconstruction of low-energy energy deposits (e.g. 39Ar beta decays) can be done with `ndlar_39Ar_reco`:  https://github.com/DUNE/ndlar_39Ar_reco

- Scripts for running the entire simulation / reconstruction chain on NERSC Perlmutter can be found in the `2x2_sim` repo: https://github.com/DUNE/2x2_sim
